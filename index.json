However, it remains a challenging task because of drastic variations in illumination or background across surveillance cameras, which causes the current methods can not work well in real-world scenarios. In addition, due to the scarce dataset, many methods suffer from over-fitting to a different extent. To remedy the above two problems, firstly, we develop a data collector and labeler, which can generate the synthetic random scenes and simultaneously annotate them without any manpower. Based on it, we build a large-scale, diverse synthetic dataset. Secondly, we propose a novel unsupervised Re-ID method via domain adaptation, which can exploit the synthetic data to boost the performance of re-identification in a completely unsupervised way, and free humans from heavy data annotations. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, and is very competitive with current cross-domain Re-ID method.","tags":[],"title":"Unsupervised domain adaptation through synthesis for person re-identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["向孙程","付宇卓","Guanjie You","刘婷"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1616155521,"objectID":"75b5e41b3a8b2101fd8ed0fb990742b6","permalink":"https://sjtu-icat.github.io/publication/xiang-2020-attribute/","publishdate":"2021-03-19T12:05:20.585767Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xiang-2020-attribute/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Attribute analysis with synthetic dataset for person re-identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["向孙程","付宇卓","刘婷"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1616140988,"objectID":"9177e08ee4cd4a71d1d93c4a286ce6ac","permalink":"https://sjtu-icat.github.io/publication/xiang-2019-deep/","publishdate":"2019-11-04T08:03:08.384351Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xiang-2019-deep/","section":"publication","summary":"The superiority of deeply learned representation has been reported in very recent literature of re-identification (Re-ID) task. In this paper, we study a novel transfer learning problem termed Distant Domain Transfer Learning (DDTL) for Re-ID task. Different from existing transfer learning problems which assume that there is a close relation between source domain and target domain, in the DDTL problem, target domain can be totally different from source domain. For example, the source domain classifies pedestrian images but the target domain distinguishes vehicle images. In this work, our goal is to execute an unseen and unrelated task based on a labeled dataset training previously without any samples from intermediate domains. Particularly, we consider the more pragmatic issue of learning a deep feature with no labels, and propose a Deep Unsupervised Progressive Learning (DUPL) method to transfer pretrained deep representations to unseen domains. Specifically, our work performs clustering and fine-tuning of the CNN to improve the performance of original model trained on the irrelevant labeled dataset. Empirical studies on distant domain adaptation task (pedestrian - vehicle) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the improvement in terms of the mAP accuracy is up to 15% over \"non-transfer\" methods.","tags":[],"title":"Deep unsupervised progressive learning for distant domain adaptation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://sjtu-icat.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://sjtu-icat.github.io/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"关于我们","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6087c0ef875554f4409ac52928d79279","permalink":"https://sjtu-icat.github.io/projects/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"历史项目","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://sjtu-icat.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"团队成员","type":"widget_page"}]
